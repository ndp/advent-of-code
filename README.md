## Advent of Code, 2022

I did the first couple weeks with Techtonica students, but as they got more 
complicated, I ended up on my own. All but 2 I believe are solved. Towards
then end the solutions got hard and time-consuming, and the holiday schedule
caused additional pressure. That being said, I don't think I ever understood
why one of them wouldn't work (Dec 22?), and just couldn't get motivated for
another (Dec 23rd?). I think Dec 25 is impossible without having solved all
the other ones.  (Andy -- May 30, 2023)
