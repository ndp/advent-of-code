Advent of Code

## [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

I have done a few of these in the past, but this year committed to 
doing them daily (at 8am Pacific). My goal is to do them quickly and cleanly,
and I'm not necessarily refactoring them into perfect solutions.

I'm opening up live coding sessions to Techtonica students and alumni.
Hit me up if you're interested.

This would be an excellent way to pick up a new language, so if I
have the energy, I may branch out for fun.
